## OVERALL ASSESSMENT

**Phone Numbers:** ✅ All correct — no old numbers found

**Schema Markup:** ⚠️ Mostly complete, missing some aggregateRating entries  
**Internal Links:** ✅ Good — all pages link to key pages  
**Content Consistency:** ⚠️ Some pages missing license numbers and "Family-owned since 2009"  

**Overall Site Health:** ⚠️ Good foundation, needs minor consistency improvements

---

## NOTES

- **Quote Form:** The quote form is embedded on the homepage at `/#quote-form`, not a separate page. This is correct and functional.
- **Phone Numbers:** All pages use the correct phone numbers: (256) 927-6287 and (706) 784-6511. No old numbers (256-407-6008 or 706-780-6554) were found.
- **Star Ratings:** All pages correctly show 4.7★ for Centre office and 4.6★ for Rome office. No incorrect 4.8★ ratings found on core pages (though service pages Renters and Life have 4.8★ in meta descriptions — see Comprehensive SEO Audit Report).
- **Schema Consistency:** Most pages have good schema markup, but some are missing aggregateRating entries for consistency.
- **Content Consistency:** About page is the most complete. Contact, FAQ, and Reviews pages could benefit from adding license numbers and "Family-owned since 2009" messaging for consistency.
